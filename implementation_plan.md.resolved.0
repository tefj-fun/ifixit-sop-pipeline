# iFixit Manual Downloader & Data Schema Design

## Goal Description
Design and implement a Python API client to download repair manuals from iFixit and structure the data in a schema suitable for training or fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to capture the instructional content (steps, text, tools) while discarding unnecessary UI elements.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The iFixit API is public but rate-limited. The client should implement polite crawling (delays) to avoid being blocked.

## Data Schema for LLM Training
The proposed schema is a JSON Lines (JSONL) format where each line represents a single manual. This format is efficient for streaming and processing large datasets.

### Schema Structure
```json
{
  "id": 12345,
  "title": "MacBook Pro 13-Inch Unibody Mid 2012 Battery Replacement",
  "url": "https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Unibody+Mid+2012+Battery+Replacement/1347",
  "category": "MacBook Pro 13\" Unibody Mid 2012",
  "difficulty": "Moderate",
  "time_required": "15 - 45 minutes",
  "tools": [
    {"name": "Phillips #00 Screwdriver", "url": "..."},
    {"name": "Tri-point Y0 Screwdriver", "url": "..."}
  ],
  "parts": [
    {"name": "MacBook Pro 13\" Unibody (Mid 2009-Mid 2012) Battery", "url": "..."}
  ],
  "steps": [
    {
      "order": 1,
      "title": "Remove the lower case screws",
      "text": "Remove the following ten screws securing the lower case to the upper case:\n* Three 3 mm Phillips #00 screws.\n* Three 13.5 mm Phillips #00 screws.\n* Four 3 mm Phillips #00 screws.",
      "images": ["https://.../image1.jpg"]
    },
    {
      "order": 2,
      "title": "Lift the lower case",
      "text": "Gently lift the lower case away from the upper case...",
      "images": ["https://.../image2.jpg"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Proposed Changes

### [NEW] `ifixit_client.py`
A Python module to interact with the iFixit API.
- `IFixitClient` class:
    - `__init__(self)`
    - `search_guides(self, query, limit=10)`: Search for guides.
    - `get_guide(self, guide_id)`: Fetch full guide details.
    - `get_categories(self)`: Fetch category hierarchy.
    - `download_manual(self, guide_id)`: Fetch and process a guide into the target schema.

### [NEW] `download_manuals.py`
A script to demonstrate usage:
- Accepts a search query or category.
- Downloads matching manuals.
- Saves them to a `data/` directory in JSONL format.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- **Unit Tests**: Test `IFixitClient` methods with mocked API responses.
- **Integration Test**: Run the script to download a single known guide (e.g., guide ID 13470) and verify the output JSON structure matches the schema.

### Manual Verification
- Run the script with a query (e.g., "MacBook Battery").
- Inspect the generated JSONL file to ensure content is readable and structured correctly.
